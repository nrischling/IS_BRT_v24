It includes conjectured, exact laws of physics expressing the regularities that allow information to be physically instantiated. Although these laws are directly about information, independently of the details of particular physical instantiations, information is not regarded as an
              a priori
              mathematical or logical concept, but as something whose nature and properties are determined by the laws of physics alone. This theory solves a problem at the foundations of existing information theory, namely that information and distinguishability are each defined in terms of the other. It also explains the relationship between classical and quantum information, and reveals the single, constructor-theoretic property underlying the most distinctive phenomena associated with the latter, including the lack of in-principle distinguishability of some states, the impossibility of cloning, the existence of pairs of variables that cannot simultaneously have sharp values, the fact that measurement processes can be both deterministic and unpredictable, the irreducible perturbation caused by measurement, and locally inaccessible information (as in entangled systems).},

	abstract = {While system complexity is on the rise across many product lines, the resources required to successfully design and implement complex systems remain constrained. Because financiers of complex systems development efforts actively monitor project implementation cost, project performance models are needed to help project managers predict their cost compliance and avoid cost overruns. This dissertation presents a cost overrun predictive model for complex systems development projects. The dissertation is based on a research undertaken to develop the cost overrun predictive model using five known drivers of complex systems development cost: system performance, technology maturity, schedule, risk, and reliability.    The dissertation demonstrates how large-scale system development project managers and systems engineers can use the model to support decision making aimed at achieving compliance with the Nunn-{McCurdy} cost overrun requirements. Sixty-nine aerospace and defense systems development projects were analyzed using logistic regression leading to the development of the predictive model. Model variables include system performance, Technology Readiness Levels ({TRL}), risk, schedule, and reliability.     The final model predictability accuracy was 62.1\% for significant cost overrun and 83.3\% for no significant cost overrun respectively, within the statistical boundaries of the research. Overall, the model is inconclusive on 10 cases, predicts 29 cases as significant cost overruns and 30 cases as on budget.  For the aerospace projects, the model is inconclusive 7.14\% of the cases; predicts 35.71\% of the cases as significant cost overruns; and predicts 57.14\% of the cases as no significant overrun outcomes. For defense projects, the model is inconclusive 19.51\% of the cases; predicts 46.34\% of the cases as significant cost overruns; and 34.15\% of the cases as no significant cost overrun outcomes. Therefore, the model predicts more cost overruns for the defense projects than for the aerospace projects. Specifically the model predicts approximately 36\% significant cost overruns for aerospace projects and 46\% for defense projects.      The model identifies schedule and reliability as the key determinants of whether or not a large complex systems development project will experience cost overrun, within constraints of the data. Projects that achieve both the defined schedule and reliability thresholds will have the lowest level of probability for a cost overrun outcome.  That is, projects that fail to meet the requirements of the schedule and reliability criteria are more likely to experience significant cost overruns, within the statistical boundaries of the model.  Interestingly, the model demonstrates that the {TRL} threshold alone is not adequate for preventing a cost overrun. However, the interaction between {TRL} and system performance parameters decreases the probability of a cost overrun.},

	abstract = {The world’s ecosystems are characterized by an unequal distribution of resources. Trade partnerships between organisms of different species - mutualisms - can help individuals cope with such resource inequality. Trade allows individuals to exchange commodities they can provide at low cost, for resources that are otherwise impossible, or more difficult, to access. However, as resources become increasingly patchy in time or space, it is unknown how organisms alter their trading strategies. Here we show how a symbiotic fungus mediates trade with a host root in response to different levels of resource inequality across its network. We developed a quantum-dot tracking technique to quantify phosphorus trading strategies of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi simultaneously exposed to rich and poor resource patches. By following fluorescent nanoparticles of different colors across fungal networks, we determined where phosphorus was hoarded, relocated and transferred to plant hosts. We found that increasing exposure to inequality stimulated trade. Fungi responded to high resource variation by: (1) increasing the total amount of phosphorus distributed to host roots; (2) decreasing allocation to storage; (3) differentially moving resources within the network, from rich to poor patches. Using single-particle tracking and high-resolution video, we show how dynamic resource movement may help the fungus capitalize on value differences across the trade network, physically moving resources to areas of high demand to gain better returns. Such translocation strategies can help symbiotic organisms cope with exposure to resource inequality.},

	abstract = {"From one of the most influential scientists of our time, a dazzling exploration of the hidden laws that govern the life cycle of everything from plants and animals to the cities we live in. The former head of the Sante Fe Institute, visionary physicist Geoffrey West is a pioneer in the field of complexity science, the science of emergent systems and networks. The term "complexity" can be misleading, however, because what makes West's discoveries so beautiful is that he has found an underlying simplicity that unites the seemingly complex and diverse phenomena of living systems, including our bodies, our cities and our businesses. Fascinated by issues of aging and mortality, West applied the rigor of a physicist to the biological question of why we live as long as we do and no longer. The result was astonishing, and changed science, creating a new understanding of energy use and metabolism: West found that despite the riotous diversity in the sizes of mammals, they are all, to a large degree, scaled versions of each other. If you know the size of a mammal, you can use scaling laws to learn everything from how much food it eats per day, what its heart-rate is, how long it will take to mature, its lifespan, and so on. Furthermore, the efficiency of the mammal's circulatory systems scales up precisely based on weight: if you compare a mouse, a human and an elephant on a logarithmic graph, you find with every doubling of average weight, a species gets 25\% more efficient--and lives 25\% longer. This speaks to everything from how long we can expect to live to how many hours of sleep we need. Fundamentally, he has proven, the issue has to do with the fractal geometry of the networks that supply energy and remove waste from the organism's body"--},

	shorttitle = {Organizational network analysis},
	abstract = {The integrated meta-model for organizational resource audit is a consistent and comprehensive instrument for auditing intangible resources and their relations and associations from the network perspective. This book undertakes a critically important problem of management sciences, poorly recognized in literature although determining the current and future competitiveness of enterprises, sectors and economies. The author notes the need to introduce a theoretical input, which is manifested by the meta-model. An expression of this treatment is the inclusion of the network as a structure of activities, further knowledge as an activity, and intangible assets as intellectual capital characterized by a structure of connections. The case study presented is an illustration of the use of network analysis tools and other instruments to identify not only the most important resources, tasks or actors, as well as their effectiveness, but also to connect the identified networks with each other. The author opens the field for applying her methodology, revealing the structural and dynamic features of the intangible resources of the organization. The novelty of the proposed meta-model shows the way to in-depth applications of network analysis techniques in an intra-organizational environment. Organizational Network Analysis makes a significant contribution to the development of management sciences, in terms of strategic management and more strictly resource approach to the company through structural definition of knowledge; application of the concept of improvement-oriented audit abandoning a narrow understanding of this technique in terms of compliance; reliable presentation of audits available in the literature; rigorous reasoning leading to the development of a meta-model; close linking of knowledge and resources with the strategy at the design stage of the developed audit model, including the analysis of link dynamics and networks together with an extensive metrics proposal; an interesting illustration of the application with the use of metrics, tables and charts. It will be of value to researchers, academics, managers, and students in the fields of strategic management, organizational studies, social network analysis in management, knowledge management, and auditing knowledge resources in organizations},

It compares the sizes of ecologically and evolutionarily caused changes in population densities in cases where the original consumer has a strong or a weak trade-off in its abilities to consume the two resources. The analysis also compares the responses of the original species to competition when the competitor’s population size is or is not limited by the shared resource. While divergence in resource use traits in the resident generalist consumer is expected under all scenarios when resources are substitutable, the changes in population densities of the resources and resident consumer frequently differ between scenarios. The population of the original consumer often decreases as a result of its own adaptive divergence, and this decrease is often much greater than the initial ecological decrease. If the evolving consumer has a strong trade-off, the overlapped resource increases in equilibrium population density in response to being consumed by a generalist competitor. Some of these predictions differ qualitatively in alternative scenarios involving sustained variation in population densities or nutritionally essential resources.},

                  Joint species distribution models ({JSDMs}) explain spatial variation in community composition by contributions of the environment, biotic associations and possibly spatially structured residual covariance. They show great promise as a general analytical framework for community ecology and macroecology, but current {JSDMs}, even when approximated by latent variables, scale poorly on large datasets, limiting their usefulness for currently emerging big (e.g. metabarcoding and metagenomics) community datasets.
                
                
                  Here, we present a novel, more scalable {JSDM} ({sjSDM}) that circumvents the need to use latent variables by using a Monte Carlo integration of the joint {JSDM} likelihood together with flexible elastic net regularization on all model components. We implemented {sjSDM} in {PyTorch}, a modern machine learning framework, which allows making use of both {CPU} and {GPU} calculations. Using simulated communities with known species–species associations and different number of species and sites, we compare {sjSDM} with state‐of‐the‐art {JSDM} implementations to determine computational runtimes and accuracy of the inferred species–species and species–environment associations.
                
                
                  We find that {sjSDM} is orders of magnitude faster than existing {JSDM} algorithms (even when run on the {CPU}) and can be scaled to very large datasets. Despite the dramatically improved speed, {sjSDM} produces more accurate estimates of species association structures than alternative {JSDM} implementations. We demonstrate the applicability of {sjSDM} to big community data using {eDNA} case study with thousands of fungi operational taxonomic units ({OTU}).
                
                
                  Our {sjSDM} approach makes the analysis of {JSDMs} to large community datasets with hundreds or thousands of species possible, substantially extending the applicability of {JSDMs} in ecology. We provide our method in an R package to facilitate its applicability for practical data analysis.},

Why do we continue to believe that life in the animal kingdom is ruled by competition? Why do we believe that humans are special for their ability to live and work together, or worse, that human society is somehow "unnatural"? In The Social Lives of Animals, animal behavior expert Ashely Ward embarks on a global search to reveal the surprising, delightful, and occasionally downright strange ways that animals build and manage societies, with both members of their own species and others. Ward studies how shoals of krill search for food by plying them with beer, visits baboons in Namibia that work for hire as goatherds, wades through a literal river of shit to study how groupthink spreads among sticklebacks, and swims with a family of sperm whales that adopted an orphaned dolphin. By studying animal societies on their own terms, we can see clearly that human societies may not be so unique. Rather, human social life may be just one version of a basic animal instinct. Biology has, since Darwin, tried to understand species by studying how they compete. But in the end, The Social Lives of Animals shows that you can often learn more about animals, including humans, by studying how they work together than by how they tear each other apart"--},

A rat in the wall. A pigeon on the street. Humans have spent so much of our history drawing a hard line between human spaces and wild places. When animals pop up where we don't expect or want them, we respond with fear, rage, or simple annoyance. It's no longer an animal. It's a pest. At the intersection of science, history, and narrative journalism, Pests is not a simple call to look closer at our urban ecosystem. It's not a natural history of the animals we hate. Instead, this book is about us. It's about what calling an animal a pest says about people, how we live, and what we want. It's a story about human nature, and how we categorize the animals in our midst, including bears and coyotes, sparrows and snakes. Pet or pest? In many cases, it's entirely a question of perspective. Bethany Brookshire's deeply researched and entirely entertaining book will show readers what there is to venerate in vermin, and help them appreciate how these animals have clawed their way to success as we did everything we could to ensure their failure. In the process, we will learn how the pests that annoy us tell us far more about humanity than they do about the animals themselves},

	abstract = {The rapid growth in greenhouse gases ({GHGs}), the lack of electricity production, and an ever-increasing demand for electrical energy requires an optimal reduction in coal-fired thermal generating units ({CFTGU}) with the aim of minimizing fuel costs and emissions. Previous approaches have been unable to deal with such problems due to the non-convexity of realistic scenarios and confined optimum convergence. Instead, meta-heuristic techniques have gained more attention in order to deal with such constrained static/dynamic economic emission load dispatch ({ELD}/{DEELD}) problems, due to their flexibility and derivative-free structures. Hence, in this work, the elephant herd optimization ({EHO}) technique is proposed in order to solve constrained non-convex static and dynamic {ELD} problems in the power system. The proposed {EHO} algorithm is a nature-inspired technique that utilizes a new separation method and elitism strategy in order to retain the diversity of the population and to ensure that the fittest individuals are retained in the next generation. The current approach can be implemented to minimize both the fuel and emission cost functions of the {CFTGUs} subject to power balance constraints, active power generation limits, and ramp rate limits in the system. Three test systems involving 6, 10, and 40 units were utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness and practical feasibility of the proposed algorithm. Numerical results indicate that the proposed {EHO} algorithm exhibits better performance in most of the test cases as compared to recent existing algorithms when applied to the static and dynamic {ELD} issue, demonstrating its superiority and practicability.},

	abstract = {Abstract
{ContextPhysiological} stress has the potential to influence animal population persistence. The endangered Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) is involved in intense conflict with humans in many parts of its range, which likely leads to stress for individuals and groups, with consequences for population survival. Thus, it is important to understand how the elephants’ stress levels are influenced by socio-ecological factors when not directly exposed to human-induced threats, and to use this understanding to improve conservation and management strategies.
{AimsThe} present study was designed to provide baseline information on the link between socio-ecological factors and stress levels of undisturbed populations of elephants. The main aim was to determine the influence of a number of factors – herd size, season, number of calves and adult females present in a herd and their lactational status and body condition – on the adrenocortical activity of free-ranging adult female Asian elephants living in protected forests (without any direct exposure to human-induced threats), by measuring their faecal glucocorticoid metabolite ({fGCM}) levels.
{MethodsA} total of 145 fresh faecal samples were collected from 123 identified adult female elephants inhabiting Bandipur and Nagarahole National Parks of southern India, between the years 2013 and 2015. {fGCM} levels were measured by employing a group-specific standardised 11-oxoetiocholanolone enzyme immunoassay ({EIA}). A generalised linear mixed-effects model ({GLMM}) was used to assess the influence of socio-ecological factors on {fGCM} levels of adult female elephants.
Key {resultsWhen} {fGCM} levels were analysed with a {GLMM}, the following patterns were observed: {fGCM} levels were negatively correlated with the number of adult females (herd size) and positively correlated with the number of calves in a herd and active lactational status of an adult female. {fGCM} levels of adult female elephants were higher during the dry season (February to May) than wet season (August to December) and negatively correlated with body condition scores.
{ConclusionsAdrenocortical} activity of female elephants is significantly influenced by the number of calves and adult females present in the herd, seasonality and lactational status.
{ImplicationsIt} is important to consider the influence of multiple ecological and social correlates when assessing and interpreting the adrenocortical activity of Asian elephants. Our findings highlight the importance of maintaining the social structure of elephants in the wild to avoid detrimental effects on their physiological health. Insights from such assessments could be used to evaluate the stress in elephants that are involved in direct conflicts with humans to take appropriate management decisions for mitigating conflicts.},

            For large mammals, area expansion is a key conservation measure to prevent species’ decline and extinction. Yet, its success depends on whether animals discover and later use these areas. Here, using {GPS} data, we investigated how herds of elephants detected and used an area made available to them after the removal of a fence. We studied the elephants’ behaviour before and after the fence removal, accounting for seasonal changes in movement patterns. In contrast to previous studies, herds visited the newly available area within a month of the fence removal, and the maximum distance they moved into the new area was reached between 5 and 9 months after the fence removal. Yet, elephants did not preferentially visit the new area at night. By the second year, all herds had shifted their seasonal home ranges and incorporated the new area, in contrast to a previous range expansion event. Our analyses show that the regular proximity of elephants to the original fence, and the fact that the new area was generally composed of preferred habitats of the elephants, probably explained the rapid discovery and use of the area. Our study improves our understanding of animal exploration and the role of habitat quality, and thus may improve range expansion and corridor programmes.},

Here, we propose that evolution might commonly alter both local and regional processes of community assembly. We show how adaptation can substantially affect community assembly and that these effects depend on regional (metacommunity) factors, including environmental heterogeneity and its spatial structure. In particular, early colonists can often arrive from a nearby community, adapt to local conditions, and subsequently alter the establishment or abundance of late-arriving species, often producing an evolutionary priority effect. We also discuss how interaction type and relative rates of colonization, evolution, and community interactions determine divergent community outcomes. We describe new conceptual approaches that provide insights into these dynamics and statistical methods that can better evaluate their importance. Overall, we demonstrate that accounting for adaptation during community assembly opens up novel ways for making progress on fundamental questions in community ecology.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Recent work linking community structure and ecosystem function has primarily focused on the effects of local species richness but has neglected the dispersal‐dependent processes of community assembly that are ultimately involved in determining community structure and its relation to ecosystems. Here we combine simple consumer‐resource competition models and metacommunity theory with discussion of case studies to outline how spatial processes within metacommunities can alter community assembly and modify expectations about how species diversity and composition influence ecosystem attributes at local scales. We argue that when community assembly is strongly limited by dispersal, this can constrain ecosystem functioning by reducing positive selection effects (reducing the probability of the most productive species becoming dominant) even though it may often also enhance complementarity (favoring combinations of species that enhance production even though they may not individually be most productive). Conversely, excess dispersal with strong source‐sink relations among heterogeneous habitats can reduce ecosystem functioning by swamping local filters that would normally favor better‐suited species. Ecosystem function is thus most likely maximized at intermediate levels of dispersal where both of these effects are minimized. In this scenario, we find that the selection effect is maximized, while complementarity is often reduced and local diversity may often be relatively low. Our synthesis emphasizes that it is the entire set of community assembly processes that affect the functioning of ecosystems, not just the part that determines local species richness.},

            The diversity of life and its organization in networks of interacting species has been a long-standing theoretical puzzle for ecologists. Ever since May’s provocative paper challenging whether ‘large complex systems [are] stable’ various hypotheses have been proposed to explain when stability should be the rule, not the exception. Spatial dynamics may be stabilizing and thus explain high community diversity, yet existing theory on spatial stabilization is limited, preventing comparisons of the role of dispersal relative to species interactions. Here we incorporate dispersal of organisms and material into stability–complexity theory. We find that stability criteria from classic theory are relaxed in direct proportion to the number of ecologically distinct patches in the meta-ecosystem. Further, we find the stabilizing effect of dispersal is maximal at intermediate intensity. Our results highlight how biodiversity can be vulnerable to factors, such as landscape fragmentation and habitat loss, that isolate local communities.},

            The convergence of semiconductor technology, physiology, and predictive health analytics from wearable devices has advanced its clinical and translational utility for sports. The detection and subsequent application of metrics pertinent to and indicative of the physical performance, physiological status, biochemical composition, and mental alertness of the athlete has been shown to reduce the risk of injuries and improve performance and has enabled the development of athlete-centered protocols and treatment plans by team physicians and trainers. Our discussions in this review include commercially available devices, as well as those described in scientific literature to provide an understanding of wearable sensors for sports medicine. The primary objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the applications of wearable technology for assessing the biomechanical and physiological parameters of the athlete. A secondary objective of this paper is to identify collaborative research opportunities among academic research groups, sports medicine health clinics, and sports team performance programs to further the utility of this technology to assist in the return-to-play for athletes across various sporting domains. A companion paper discusses the use of wearables to monitor the biochemical profile and mental acuity of the athlete.},

This deep dive into the rise of analytics in soccer--a sport where tradition reigns supreme--shows how revolutionary tactics and underexplored metrics are breaking the beautiful game wide open. By exploring how massive institutions built on billions of dollars can function for so long without any kind of introspection--and what happens when people from the outside attempt to question the status quo--author Ryan O'Hanlon, staff writer at {ESPN}, shows how time and again experts, managers, coaches, players, and fans feel they know the best approach for any given team or player, and yet get undermined by the complexity of the game--and human behavior. To tell this globe-trekking story, O'Hanlon takes readers inside the front offices and analytics departments of the top professional leagues' most cutting-edge clubs and profiles a misfit cast of number-crunchers, behavioral economists, tech insiders, and managers all working to move beyond the philosophical side of soccer and uncover the hard truths behind possession, goals, and developing talent."--Amazon.com},

However, these characteristic institutes are screened by larger universities if we depend on the existing

The open-source Phenotyping Hybrid Information System ({PHIS}) is proposed for plant phenotyping experiments in various categories of installations (field, glasshouse). It unambiguously identifies all objects and traits in an experiment and establishes their relations via ontologies and semantics that apply to both field and controlled conditions. For instance, the genotype is declared for a plant or plot and is associated with all objects related to it. Events such as successive plant positions, anomalies and annotations are associated with objects so they can be easily retrieved. Its ontology-driven architecture is a powerful tool for integrating and managing data from multiple experiments and platforms, for creating relationships between objects and enriching datasets with knowledge and metadata. It interoperates with external resources via web services, thereby allowing data integration into other systems; for example, modelling platforms or external databases. It has the potential for rapid diffusion because of its ability to integrate, manage and visualize multi-source and multi-scale data, but also because it is based on 10 yr of trial and error in our groups.},

Quantum communications requires unusually narrow optical beams and tight pointing performance (on the order of ten microradians) to close an inherently brightness-limited quantum link. This limit is due to quantum communication protocols such as quantum key distribution and teleportation requiring individual quantum states to be transmitted with photon number restrictions. We examine an opportunity to combine quantum communications with laser communications in sharing an optical link. We discuss a combined quantum and laser communication terminal capable of performing space-to-ground entanglement-distribution and high data rate communications on a 12U {CubeSat} with a 95 mm beam expander and an 60 cm aperture optical ground telescope. Photon pairs produced by the quantum terminal are entangled in polarization so the polarization must be maintained throughout the optical link. We discuss active and passive compensation methods in space and polarization reference frame correction using a polarized reference beacon at the ground station. The combined quantum and laser communication terminal approach enables secure communications over an optical channel with rates of 100 Mbps and sub-nanosecond time transfer.},

Intra-ﬁrm collaboration is also found to have a direct impact on organizational performance. However, the impact of inter-organizational collaboration on performance is found to be only indirect, through the impact of intra-organizational collaboration.

            Mechanistic computational models enable the study of regulatory mechanisms implicated in various biological processes. These models provide a means to analyze the dynamics of the systems they describe, and to study and interrogate their properties, and provide insights about the emerging behavior of the system in the presence of single or combined perturbations. Aimed at those who are new to computational modeling, we present here a practical hands-on protocol breaking down the process of mechanistic modeling of biological systems in a succession of precise steps. The protocol provides a framework that includes defining the model scope, choosing validation criteria, selecting the appropriate modeling approach, constructing a model and simulating the model. To ensure broad accessibility of the protocol, we use a logical modeling framework, which presents a lower mathematical barrier of entry, and two easy-to-use and popular modeling software tools: Cell Collective and {GINsim}. The complete modeling workflow is applied to a well-studied and familiar biological process—the lac operon regulatory system. The protocol can be completed by users with little to no prior computational modeling experience approximately within 3 h.},

Bivariate and multiple linear regression analyses were performed. Five variables were associated with Interactional Characteristics (knowledge sharing, knowledge integration, affective commitment toward the team, team climate, team autonomy), and one variable with Professional Role (multifocal identification) and Individual Characteristics (age), respectively. Findings suggest the importance of positive team climate, knowledge sharing and knowledge integration, professional and team identification (multifocal identification), team commitment and autonomy for strengthening {IPC} in {MH} teams. These results suggest that team managers should remain alert to behavioral changes and tensions in their teams that could signal possible deterioration in {IPC}, while promoting {IPC} competencies, and interdisciplinary values and skills, in team activities and training programs. As well, the encouragement of team commitment on the part of senior professionals, and support toward their younger counterparts, may enhance {IPC} in teams.},

We then clarify the hyper-systemizing theory, contrasting it to the weak central coherence ({WCC}) and executive dysfunction ({ED}) theories. The {ED} theory has difficulty explaining the existence of talent in {ASC}. While both hyper-systemizing and {WCC} theories postulate
              excellent attention to detail
              , by itself excellent attention to detail will not produce talent. By contrast, the hyper-systemizing theory argues that the excellent attention to detail is directed towards detecting ‘if p, then q’ rules (or [input–operation–output] reasoning). Such law-based pattern recognition systems can produce talent in systemizable domains. Finally, we argue that the excellent attention to detail in {ASC} is itself a consequence of
              sensory hypersensitivity
              . We review an experiment from our laboratory demonstrating sensory hypersensitivity detection thresholds in vision. We conclude that the origins of the association between autism and talent begin at the sensory level, include excellent attention to detail and end with hyper-systemizing.},

	abstract = {This paper conducts a thorough investigation of the relationship between knowledge management, meta-ecosystem dynamics, and category theory within an organizational setting. The focus is on collaboration and knowledge sharing, crucial elements for organizational success. To draw parallels between natural systems and organizational ecosystems, data from studies on mycorrhizal networks are analyzed. Organizational knowledge management involves creating, sharing, using, and managing knowledge and information within an organization. Meta-ecosystem dynamics, a concept derived from ecology, pertains to the dynamics of interconnected ecosystems through the movement of organisms and materials across ecosystem boundaries. Similarly, different organizations or units within an organization are viewed as interconnected ecosystems. Category theory, a branch of mathematics, provides a framework for understanding relationships and interactions between entities in an ecosystem, including organizational ecosystems. The concepts are integrated to offer a fresh perspective on organizational knowledge management. By exploring how knowledge flows within and between organizations, how organizational ecosystem structures and dynamics influence these flows, and how to optimize them for better knowledge management, advanced biomimetic knowledge management models can be developed. The paper delves into each concept, explores intersections, and discusses how they can be integrated to enhance organizational knowledge management. The research offers potential insights into improving organizational knowledge management.},

	abstract = {Increasing cropping system diversity has great potential to address environmental problems associated with modern agriculture, such as erosion, soil carbon loss, nutrient runoff, water pollution, and loss of biodiversity. As with other agricultural sciences, plant breeding has primarily been conducted in the context of dominant monoculture cropping systems, with little focus on multicrop systems. Multicrop systems have increased temporal and/or spatial diversity and include a diverse set of crops and practices. In order to support a transition to multicrop systems, plant breeders must shift their breeding programs and objectives to better represent more diverse systems, including diverse rotations, alternate-season crops, ecosystem service crops, and intercropping systems. The degree to which breeding methods need to change will depend on the cropping system context in question. Plant breeding alone, however, cannot drive adoption of multicrop systems. Alongside shifts in breeding approaches, changes are needed within broader research, private sector, and policy contexts. These changes include policies and investments that support a transition to multicrop systems, increased collaboration across disciplines to support cropping system development, and leadership from both the public and private sectors to develop and promote adoption of new cultivars.},

However, current remote-sensing models for assessing burn severity and forest change in the U.S. are generally based on data collected from California, {USA}, forests and may not be suitable in other forested ecoregions. To address this problem, we collected field data from 21 wildfires in the American Southwest and developed region-specific models for assessing post-wildfire burn severity and forest change from remotely sensed imagery. We created indices (delta normalized burn ratio ({dNBR}), relative delta normalized burn ratio ({RdNBR}), and the relative burn ratio ({RBR})) from Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery using pre- and post-fire image pairs. Burn severity models built from southwest U.S. data had clear advantages compared to the current California-based models. Canopy cover and basal area change models built from southwest U.S. data performed better as continuous predictors but not as categorical predictors.},

Recently, {CMNs} have captured the interest of broad audiences, especially with respect to forest function and management. We are concerned, however, that recent claims in the popular media about {CMNs} in forests are disconnected from evidence, and that bias towards citing positive effects of {CMNs} has developed in the scientific literature. We first evaluated the evidence supporting three common claims. The claims that {CMNs} are widespread in forests and that resources are transferred through {CMNs} to increase seedling performance are insufficiently supported because results from field studies vary too widely, have alternative explanations or are too limited to support generalizations. The claim that mature trees preferentially send resources and defence signals to offspring through {CMNs} has no peer-reviewed, published evidence. We next examined how the results from {CMN} research are cited and found that unsupported claims have doubled in the past 25 years; a bias towards citing positive effects may obscure our understanding of the structure and function of {CMNs} in forests. We conclude that knowledge on {CMNs} is presently too sparse and unsettled to inform forest management.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              
                The purpose of this paper is to study the influence of organizational environment on the selection of knowledge management strategies. The paper focuses particularly on the relationship between business and knowledge management strategy and the success of the knowledge management initiatives.
              
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              
                This paper is a case study researching 11 German and Swiss companies. The knowledge management initiatives were categorized by six criteria (objectives, processes, problems, content, strategy, knowledge type) and their fit with the respective business strategy of the organizational unit was evaluated.
              
            
            
              Findings
              
                The findings in this paper suggest a relationship between the success of knowledge management and the alignment of knowledge management and business strategy. The paper also shows that an organization whose business strategy requires process efficiency should rely primarily on a codification strategy. An organization whose business strategy requires product/process innovation should rely primarily on a personalization strategy. The most successful knowledge management projects were driven by a strong business need and with the goal to add value to the organizational unit operations.
              
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              
                The paper shows there are limitations due to the qualitative nature of the research: logical rather than statistical conclusions, small sample size, and subjectivity of interpretations.
              
            
            
              Practical implications
              
                The paper sees that a manager should be aware of the objectives and business processes of the organizational unit and chooses the knowledge management strategy and objective in accordance to the business strategy and objective.

The purposes of this study are (1) to determine which facilitators, from the point of view of master’s degree students related to engineering and construction management in Spain, most substantially influence knowledge sharing capability; (2) to test whether knowledge sharing capability ({KS}) positively influences innovative behavior ({IB}); and (3) demonstrating whether organizational innovation climate ({OIC}) is a factor that moderates the relationship between {KS} and {IB}. In this research, we have proposed a theoretical model and empirically tested the model in a sample of 253 master’s degree students in public universities in Spain. The findings support the proposed model, and the structural equation modeling ({SEM}) evaluation suggests that, among all the facilitators of {KS}, information and communication technologies ({ICT}) stand out among the other facilitators and have a more significant influence on {KS}.

	abstract = {We propose the hierarchical recursive neural network ({HERO}) to predict fake news by learning its linguistic style, which is distinguishable from the truth, as psychological theories reveal. We first generate the hierarchical linguistic tree of news documents; by doing so, we translate each news document's linguistic style into its writer's usage of words and how these words are recursively structured as phrases, sentences, paragraphs, and, ultimately, the document. By integrating the hierarchical linguistic tree with the neural network, the proposed method learns and classifies the representation of news documents by capturing their locally sequential and globally recursive structures that are linguistically meaningful. It is the first work offering the hierarchical linguistic tree and the neural network preserving the tree information to our best knowledge. Experimental results based on public real-world datasets demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness, which can outperform state-of-the-art techniques in classifying short and long news documents. We also examine the differential linguistic style of fake news and the truth and observe some patterns of fake news. The code and data have been publicly available.},

	abstract = {When Twitter launched in March 2006, the earth did not move. Its founders and a few early funders were excited about the technology, but the microblogging site was not the immediate blockbuster you might imagine it was, given that it now has more than 300 million users and has become a wildly influential marketing tool for businesses, nonprofits, and even politicians. Rather, Twitter crept along in its early months, growing slowly. Twitter seems on the surface to be the kind of technology that journalist Malcolm Gladwell and Wharton School marketing professor Jonah Berger refer to as "contagious." To jump-start Twitter's growth, its founders decided to promote it at a South by Southwest Interactive conference in 2007, where it was a big hit. In a very interesting study, Twitter's actual growth pattern was revealed to be surprisingly geographic. Friends and neighbors adopted the technology from one another in much the same way people join a {PTA} fund-raiser or get excited about a candidate for town office.},

The main purpose of the paper is to call on the members of the {IS} profession to take a more proactive and visible role in advancing {KM} by showing that {KM} is a natural and long-awaited development in {IS} and that a number of circumstances have made {KM} to be an area of emphasis in {IS} whose time has come. The paper also aims at contributing towards achieving a consensus among {IS} professionals on conceptualization, goals, and scope of {KM} in {IS}.

	abstract = {Nowadays, cooperative multi-agent systems are used to learn how to achieve goals in large-scale dynamic environments. However, learning in these environments is challenging: from the effect of search space size on learning time to inefficient cooperation among agents. Moreover, reinforcement learning algorithms may suffer from a long time of convergence in such environments. In this paper, a communication framework is introduced. In the proposed communication framework, agents learn to cooperate effectively, and also by the introduction of a new state calculation method, the size of state space has declined considerably. Furthermore, a knowledge transferring algorithm is presented to share the gained experiences among the different agents, and an effective knowledge fusing mechanism is developed to fuse the agents' own experiences with the experiences received from other team members. Finally, the simulation results are provided to indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method in complex learning tasks. We have evaluated our approach on the shepherding problem and the results show that the learning process has been accelerated by making use of the knowledge transferring mechanism and the size of state space has been declined by generating similar states based on the state abstraction concept.},

	abstract = {We investigate the application of mesoscopic response functions ({MRFs}) to characterize a large set of networks of fungi and slime moulds grown under a wide variety of different experimental treatments, including inter-species competition and attack by fungivores. We construct 'structural networks' by estimating cord conductances (which yield edge weights) from the experimental data, and we construct 'functional networks' by calculating edge weights based on how much nutrient traffic is predicted to occur along each edge. Both types of networks have the same topology, and we compute {MRFs} for both families of networks to illustrate two different ways of constructing taxonomies to group the networks into clusters of related fungi and slime moulds. Although both network taxonomies generate intuitively sensible groupings of networks across species, treatments and laboratories, we find that clustering using the functional-network measure appears to give groups with lower intra-group variation in species or treatments. We argue that {MRFs} provide a useful quantitative analysis of network behaviour that can (1) help summarize an expanding set of increasingly complex biological networks and (2) help extract information that captures subtle changes in intra- and inter-specific phenotypic traits that are integral to a mechanistic understanding of fungal behaviour and ecology. As an accompaniment to our paper, we also make a large data set of fungal networks available in the public domain.},

                The purpose of this paper is to explore the development of a knowledge management ({KM}) strategy at the Central Bank of Nigeria ({CBN}) and how this was embedded in the business processes of the bank.
              
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              
                Literature research and a case study were used as the methodology of the paper.
              
            
            
              Findings
              
                The need to align {KM} strategy with business strategy was identified as critical to the success of {KM}. It was discovered that focusing {KM} on the Bank's payments system process helped create value and drive business results. A combined approach of codification and personalization was adopted for the {KM} program of {CBN}. The strategy adopted involved using a two‐pronged approach of communities of practice and a functional portal to drive knowledge management. The paper identifies that this strategy is adding value to the organization and increasing knowledge flows across a dispersed and distributed work environment.
              
            
            
              Originality/value
              
                Knowledge management in large public sector organizations in Africa is not common. Equally, {KM} in regulatory financial institutions like Central Banks in Africa is not very common. The paper highlights the challenges of implementing a {KM} program in a distributed, dispersed and networked public sector organization with 36 branches serving a population of 160 million people in sub‐Saharan Africa.},

Results suggest incorporating nature-based practices into preschool was effective, as children in preschool classrooms where nature-based practices were used had significantly higher levels of {EF} at the end of the school year than children in programs where nature-based practices were more minimally used. Preschools that used a blended approach (some incorporation of nature-based practices) were significantly more effective than preschools that had lesser incorporation of nature-based practices.

One key difficulty in the study of complex agent interactions is the difficulty of modeling agent  communication on the basis of rewards. Game theory offers a perspective of analysis and modeling these interactions. Previously, while a large amount of literature is available on game theory, most of it is from specific domains and does not cater for the concepts from an agent-based perspective.

	abstract = {Most terrestrial plants establish symbiotic associations with mycorrhizal fungi for accessing essential plant nutrients. Mycorrhizal fungi have been frequently reported to interconnect plants via a common mycelial network ({CMN}), in which nutrients and signaling compounds can be exchanged between the connected plants. Several studies have been performed to demonstrate the potential effects of the {CMN} mediating resource transfer and its importance for plant fitness. Due to several contrasting results, different theories have been developed to predict benefits or disadvantages for host plants involved in the network and how it might affect plant communities. However, the importance of the mycelium connections for resources translocation compared to other indirect pathways, such as leakage of fungi hyphae and subsequent uptake by neighboring plant roots, is hard to distinguish and quantify. If resources can be translocated via mycelial connections in significant amounts that could affect plant fitness, it would represent an important tactic for plants co-existence and it could shape community composition and dynamics. Here, we report and critically discuss the most recent findings on studies aiming to evaluate and quantify resources translocation between plants sharing a {CMN} and predict the pattern that drives the movement of such resources into the {CMN}. We aim to point gaps and define open questions to guide upcoming studies in the area for a prospect better understanding of possible plant-to-plant interactions via {CMN} and its effect in shaping plants communities. We also propose new experiment set-ups and technologies that could be used to improve previous experiments. For example, the use of mutant lines plants with manipulation of genes involved in the symbiotic associations, coupled with labeling techniques to track resources translocation between connected plants, could provide a more accurate idea about resource allocation and plant physiological responses that are truly accountable to {CMN}.},

Here, we try to link network structure with impact on resource movement at diﬀerent scales of organization to understand the beneﬁts and challenges of organisms that grow as connected networks.

	abstract = {Abstract In multi-agent reinforcement learning, transfer learning is one of the key techniques used to speed up learning performance through the exchange of knowledge among agents. However, there are three challenges associated with applying this technique to real-world problems. First, most real-world domains are partially rather than fully observable. Second, it is difficult to pre-collect knowledge in unknown domains. Third, negative transfer impedes the learning progress. We observe that differentially private mechanisms can overcome these challenges due to their randomization property. Therefore, we propose a novel differential transfer learning method for multi-agent reinforcement learning problems, characterized by the following three key features. First, our method allows agents to implement real-time knowledge transfers between each other in partially observable domains. Second, our method eliminates the constraints on the relevance of transferred knowledge, which expands the knowledge set to a large extent. Third, our method improves robustness to negative transfers by applying differentially exponential noise and relevance weights to transferred knowledge. The proposed method is the first to use the randomization property of differential privacy to stimulate the learning performance in multi-agent reinforcement learning system. We further implement extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

Here we synthesize current information about how the presence and type of mycorrhizal association affect plant communities. We argue that mycorrhizal fungi regulate seedling establishment and species coexistence through stabilizing and equalizing mechanisms such as soil nutrient partitioning, feedback to soil antagonists, differential mycorrhizal benefits, and nutrient trade. Mycorrhizal fungi have strong effects on plant population and community biology, with mycorrhizal type?specific effects on seed dispersal, seedling establishment, and soil niche differentiation, as well as interspecific and intraspecific competition and hence plant diversity.},

Therefore, the rate of awareness and adoption of Agile frameworks both within and outside the software industry has increased significantly. Yet, the latest studies show that the adoption of Agile techniques and practices are not one-size-fits-all, and highlight the challenges, risks, and limitations regarding numerous domains. In this regard, the state-of-the-art literature provides comprehensive reading. However, in the case of hardware manufacturing, it seems to be sparse and fragmented. To fill this gap, the goal of this study is to analyze and present an in-depth account of the implementation of mix agile-oriented tools and practices. To tackle this goal, a single industry case study was undertaken, based on the primary data obtained through the interview protocol and the secondary data extracted from the project’s documentation. The findings concern three areas. First, the rationale behind the implementation of agile for hardware development is explained. Second, the implemented agile techniques and practices are identified, as well as the supporting tools through which their adoption was successfully undertaken. Third, the areas positively impacted by their application are highlighted with the corresponding evaluation measures deployed; moreover, the barriers to adopting Agile practices encountered, and the benefits gained from particular techniques, are further discussed. The presented findings might be of great importance for both researchers and practitioners who are searching for empirical evidence regarding Agile-oriented implementations. Finally, in terms of both benefits and barriers, business implications for hardware development are formulated. Alongside this, numerous open issues and questions present interesting research avenues that concern, in particular, the effectiveness of collaboration and areas of communication through the lens of agile techniques and practices.},

Correspondingly, either quantitative models or qualitative models can be deﬁned; bridging the gap between these two worlds would allow us to simultaneously exploit the peculiar advantages provided by each modeling approach. However, to date, the attempts in this direction have been limited to speciﬁc ﬁelds of research. In this paper, we propose a novel, general-purpose computational framework, named Fuzzy-mechanistic modeling of {compleX} systems ({FuzzX}), for the analysis of hybrid models consisting of a quantitative (or mechanistic) module and a qualitative module that can reciprocally control each other’s dynamic behavior through a common interface. {FuzzX} takes advantage of precise quantitative information about the system through the deﬁnition and simulation of the mechanistic module. At the same time, it describes the behavior of components and their interactions that are not known in full details, by exploiting fuzzy logic for the deﬁnition of the qualitative module. We applied {FuzzX} for the analysis of a hybrid model of a complex biochemical system, characterized by the presence of positive and negative feedback regulations. We show that {FuzzX} is able to correctly reproduce known emergent behaviors of this system in normal and perturbed conditions. We envision that {FuzzX} could be employed to analyze any kind of complex system when quantitative information is limited, as well as to extend existing mechanistic models with fuzzy modules to describe those components and interactions of the system that are not fully characterized.},

Current ﬁre simulation models ﬁt into two general categories: 5 empirical models and physical models. We present a new modelling approach that uses agent-based modelling to combine the complexity found in physical models with the ease of computation of empirical models. Our model represents the ﬁre front as a set of moving agents that respond to, and interact with, vegetation, wind, and terrain. We calibrate the model using two simulated ﬁres and one real ﬁre, and validate the model against another real ﬁre and the interim behaviour of the real calibration ﬁre. Our model successfully replicates these ﬁres, with a Figure of Merit on par with simulations by the Prometheus simulation 10 model. Our model is a stepping-stone in using agent-based modelling for ﬁre behaviour simulation, as we demonstrate the ability of agent-based modelling to replicate ﬁre behaviour through emergence alone.},

	abstract = {Prosocial behavior is a central feature of human life and a major focus of research across the natural and soc sciences. Most theoretical models of prosociality share a common assumption: Humans are instinctively selfish, prosocial behavior requires exerting reflective control over these basic instincts. However, findings from se scientific disciplines have recently contradicted this view. Rather than requiring control over instinctive selfish prosocial behavior appears to stem from processes that are intuitive, reflexive, and even automatic. These observ suggest that our understanding of prosociality should be revised to include the possibility that, in many cases, prosoci behavior - instead of requiring active control over our impulses - represents an impulse of its own.},

Building on Transactive Memory Theory, I argue that bicultural team members have a latent potential to enhance the transactive memory systems and performance of their teams. However, I propose that this potential is only fully realized when the characteristics of the individual and team are synchronized. More speciﬁcally, I argue that biculturals may have a different impact on culturally homogenous teams, culturally diverse teams, and teams characterized by a deep cultural faultline, depending on whether the biculturals share neither, one, or both of their cultures with other members of the team. In order to integrate these ideas, I develop a dynamic, multi-level theoretical model that delineates the relationships in question. © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Indeed, many of us go to great lengths to avoid situations that may engender these experiences (such as public speaking). Why is it that these negative social experiences have such a profound effect on our emotional well-being? Emerging evidence suggests that experiences of social pain —the painful feelings associated with social disconnection — rely on some of the same neurobiological substrates that underlie experiences of physical pain. Understanding the ways in which physical and social pain overlap may provide new insights into the surprising relationship between these two types of experiences.},

We conducted two studies focusing on dissenting social majority members (individuals who hold dissenting deep-level task perspectives yet belong to the surface-level majority) in three-person groups. The results show that surface-level diverse groups (with two similar and one dissimilar individuals) were perceived as more positive and accepting, fostered more persistent and {conWdent} voicing of dissenting perspectives, and displayed greater task engagement than surface-level homogeneous groups (containing all similar individuals). Surface-level diversity (both task-relevant and irrelevant) may be {beneWcial} for groups even when the group member who is {diVerent} on the surface does not have a {diVerent} deep-level task perspective to share.

	abstract = {Despite 5G still being embryonic in its development, there is already a quest for evidence to support decision-making in government and industry. Although there is still considerable technological, economic and behavioural uncertainty, exploration of how the potential rollout may take place both spatially and temporally is required for effective policy formulation. Consequently, the cost, coverage and rollout implications of 5G networks across Britain are explored by extrapolating 4G {LTE} and {LTE}-Advanced characteristics for the period 2020–2030. We focus on ubiquitous ultrafast broadband of 50 Mbps and test the impact of annual capital intensity, infrastructure sharing and reducing the end-user speed in rural areas to either 10 or 30 Mbps. For the business-as-usual scenario we ﬁnd that 90\% of the population is covered with 5G by 2027, but coverage is unlikely to reach the ﬁnal 10\% due to exponentially increasing costs. Moreover, varying annual capital intensity or deploying a shared small cell network can greatly inﬂuence the time taken to reach the 90\% threshold, with these changes mostly beneﬁting rural areas. Importantly, simply by integrating new and existing spectrum, a network capable of achieving 10 Mbps per rural user is possible, which is comparable to the {UK}'s current ﬁxed broadband Universal Service Obligation. We contribute to the literature by quantifying the effectiveness of the spatial and temporal rollout of 5G under different policy options.},

We compare evidence from 203 space missions at {NASA} and {SpaceX}, on cost, speed-to-market, schedule, and scalability. We find that {SpaceX}’s platform strategy was 10X cheaper and 2X faster than {NASA}’s bespoke strategy. Moreover, {SpaceX}’s platform strategy was financially less risky, virtually eliminating cost overruns. Finally, we show that achieving platform repeatability is a strategically diligent process involving experimental learning sequences. Sectors of the economy where governments find it difficult to control spending or timeframes or to realize planned benefits – e.g., health, education, climate, defence – are ripe for a platform rethink.},

The best reviews synthesize studies to draw broad theoretical conclusions about what a literature means, linking theory to evidence and evidence to theory. This guide describes how to plan, conduct, organize, and present a systematic review of quantitative (meta-analysis) or qualitative (narrative review, meta-synthesis) information. We outline core standards and principles and describe commonly encountered problems. Although this guide targets psychological scientists, its high level of abstraction makes it potentially relevant to any subject area or discipline.

We summarize our journey thus far relative to six signposts, namely: (a) the identiﬁcation of ﬁve key beliefs underlying change recipient motivations to change; (b) an emphasis on change recipient active participation in the change effort; (c) the importance of diagnosis; (d) the importance of creating readiness for change; (e) the identiﬁcation of strategies for inﬂuencing the ﬁve beliefs throughout the change process; and, (f) the assessment of reactions to organizational change. To give an idea of where our journeys will take us in the future, we identify ﬁve trips we plan to make: (a) examine the relative importance of the ﬁve key beliefs for inﬂuencing change recipient support; (b) expand our cognitive view of change motivation to include emotional reactions to change; (c) investigate the relationship between change recipient characteristics (such as regulatory focus) and reactions to organizational transformation; (d) explore the relationship between internal contextual variables (relations with local change agents and co-workers) during organizational change; and (e) focus on ethics in organizational change.},

The proposed {IWFFDA}-{DL} system includes an Integrated sensor system ({ISS}) combining an array of sensors that acts as the major input source that helps to forecast the ﬁre. Then, the attention based convolution neural network with bidirectional long short term memory ({ACNN}-{BLSTM}) model is applied to examine and identify the existence of danger. For hyperparameter tuning of the {ACNN}-{BLSTM} model, the bacterial foraging optimization ({BFO}) algorithm is employed and thereby enhances the detection performance. Finally, when the ﬁre is detected, the Global System for Mobiles ({GSM}) modem transmits messages to the authorities to take required actions. An extensive set of simulations were performed and the results are investigated interms of several aspects.

            Computational models of biological systems can exploit a broad range of rapidly developing approaches, including novel experimental approaches, bioinformatics data analysis, emerging modelling paradigms, data standards and algorithms. A discussion about the most recent advances among experts from various domains is crucial to foster data-driven computational modelling and its growing use in assessing and predicting the behaviour of biological systems. Intending to encourage the development of tools, approaches and predictive models, and to deepen our understanding of biological systems, the Community of Special Interest ({COSI}) was launched in Computational Modelling of Biological Systems ({SysMod}) in 2016. {SysMod}’s main activity is an annual meeting at the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology ({ISMB}) conference, which brings together computer scientists, biologists, mathematicians, engineers, computational and systems biologists. In the five years since its inception, {SysMod} has evolved into a dynamic and expanding community, as the increasing number of contributions and participants illustrate. {SysMod} maintains several online resources to facilitate interaction among the community members, including an online forum, a calendar of relevant meetings and a {YouTube} channel with talks and lectures of interest for the modelling community. For more than half a decade, the growing interest in computational systems modelling and multi-scale data integration has inspired and supported the {SysMod} community. Its members get progressively more involved and actively contribute to the annual {COSI} meeting and several related community workshops and meetings, focusing on specific topics, including particular techniques for computational modelling or standardisation efforts.},

Admittedly, the definition of Monads in Category Theory is too subtle and obscure so makes people to avoid from trying to understand them. In this paper, we attempt to explore popular Monads in a purely functional programming language, Haskell, with a Category-theoretic mindset. Starting from the definition of Monads, we describe how they are defined and implemented in Haskell. In particular, we classify Monads by their implementation style, and it turns out that a common fallacy of using Monad metaphors can be understood in this vein. Also, we explain why {IO} Monad is particularly important in Haskell and what its role is, in a programmer’s perspective. Furthermore, we design a new Monad, called S Monad, in order to represent the system call abstractions, and shed light on a future Haskell {OS} using S Monad to represent the system call abstractions.},

The paper to which this database is connected aims to advance the theoretical understanding of the relationship between collaborations and media innovation. We formulate an original analytical model to assess the inﬂuence of organisational factors of collaborations on knowledge sharing, a key condition for explorative innovation. Based on the experience of the Stars4Media programme, we present an empirical application of the analytical model (based on this dataset) to a case study of thirty collaborative projects involving seventy-six European media companies.},

	shorttitle = {A unified meta‐ecosystem dynamics model},
	abstract = {Determining the relative inﬂuence of biotic and abiotic processes in structuring communities at local to large spatial scales is best understood using a biogeographic comparativeexperimental approach. Using this approach, previous work suggests that intertidal community dynamics (top-down and bottom-up eﬀects) vary unimodally along an upwellingbased productivity gradient, termed the Intermittent Upwelling Hypothesis ({IUH}). Evidence consistent with the {IUH} comes from the sessile invertebrate/predator ({SIP}) subweb in certain rocky intertidal communities, but whether this pattern extends to macrophyte/herbivore ({MH}) subwebs is unknown. Here we ask: Are {MH} subwebs also structured as predicted by the {IUH}? What is the relative importance of herbivory and predation in structuring these communities? Under what conditions do ecological subsidies like nutrients or propagule production drive community dynamics? And are omnivorous interactions important? We hypothesize that {MH} subwebs are driven by a new construct, the Grazing-Weakening Hypothesis ({GWH}), which states that {MH} interactions weaken monotonically with increasing nutrients, with strong (weak) herbivory and low (high) macrophyte productivity at low (high) nutrients. We explored local-to-large spatial scale dynamics of both subwebs using a biogeographic comparative-experimental factorial ﬁeld experiment testing joint and separate eﬀects of herbivores and predators between two continents. Experiments at ten sites ranging across from persistent upwelling to persistent downwelling regimes ran for 26-29 months in Oregon and California, and New Zealand South Island. For the {MH} subweb, results were consistent with the {GWH}: herbivory declined and macrophytes increased with increasing nutrients. As expected, results for the {SIP} subweb were consistent with the {IUH}: predator eﬀect size was unimodally related to upwelling. Overall, herbivory explained more variation in community structure than did predation, especially in New Zealand. Omnivory was weak, sessile invertebrates outcompeted macrophytes, and ocean-driven subsidies provided the basic template driving ecosystem dynamics. We propose a uniﬁed Meta-Ecosystem Dynamics Model ({MEcoDynaMo}) combining {MH} and {SIP} results: with increased upwelling, sessile invertebrates and underlying dynamics vary unimodally (as in the {IUH}), while herbivory decreases and macrophytes generally increase. While this model was based on research in temperate ecosystems varying in upwelling regime, its wider applicability remains to be tested.},

	abstract = {Unitary quantum theory, having no Born Rule, is
              non-probabilistic
              . Hence the notorious problem of reconciling it with the
              unpredictability
              and
              appearance of stochasticity
              in quantum measurements. Generalizing and improving upon the so-called ‘decision-theoretic approach’, I shall recast that problem in the recently proposed
              constructor theory of information—
              where quantum theory is represented as one of a class of
              superinformation theories
              , which are
              local
              ,
              non-probabilistic
              theories conforming to certain constructor-theoretic conditions. I prove that the unpredictability of measurement outcomes (to which constructor theory gives an exact meaning) necessarily arises in superinformation theories. Then I explain how the appearance of stochasticity in (finitely many) repeated measurements can arise under superinformation theories. And I establish sufficient
              conditions
              for a superinformation theory to inform decisions (made under it)
              as if
              it were probabilistic, via a Deutsch–Wallace-type argument—thus defining a class of
              decision-supporting
              superinformation theories. This broadens the domain of applicability of that argument to cover constructor-theory compliant theories. In addition, in this version some of the argument's assumptions, previously construed as merely decision-theoretic, follow from
              physical properties
              expressed by constructor-theoretic principles.},

	abstract = {The last 25 years have seen significant advances in our understanding of the mycorrhizal fungi that colonize most of the world's plants, and the mycorrhizal networks that form and extend into the soil beyond plant roots. In addition to a thorough review of recent research on mycorrhizal networks, this book provides readers with alternative perspectives. The book is organized into three sections: Network Structure, Nutrient Dynamics, and the Mutualism-Parasitism Continuum. Chapter 1 addresses the specificity of ectomycorrhizal symbionts and its role in plant communities, and provides an updated list of terms and definitions. Chapter 2 explores interactions between symbionts in mycorrhizal fungi networks, as well as interactions between fungal individuals. The second section of the book begins with the examination in Chapter 3 of extramatrical mycelium (mycelia beyond the root tips) in ectomycorrhizal fungi, focused on carbon and nitrogen. Chapter 4 reviews the influence of mycorrhizal networks on outcomes of plant competition in arbuscular mycorrhizal plant communities. Chapter 5 discusses nutrient movement between plants through networks with a focus on the magnitude, fate and importance of my corrhiza-derived nutrients in ectomycorrhizal plants. Section 3 opens with a review of research on the role of ectomycorrhizal networks on seedling establishment in a primary successional habitat, in Chapter 6. The focus of Chapter 7 is on facilitation and antagonism in arbuscular mycorrhizal networks. Chapter 8 explores the unique networking dynamic of Alnus, which differs from most ectomycorrhizal plant hosts in forming isolated networks with little direct connections to networks of other host species in a forest. Chapter 9 argues that most experiments have not adequately tested the role of mycorrhizal networks on plant community dynamics, and suggests more tests to rule out alternative hypotheses to carbon movement between plants, especially those that include experimental manipulations of the mycorrhizal networks. Plant ecologists have accumulated a rich body of knowledge regarding nutrient acquisition by plants. The editor proposes that research indicating that mycorrhizal fungi compete for nutrients, which are then delivered to multiple hosts through mycorrhizal networks, represents an important new paradigm for plant ecologists},

Here we report on the follow-up mission of {SpooQy}-1, a 3U {CubeSat} that successfully demonstrated the generation of polarization-entangled photons in orbit. The next iteration of the mission will showcase satellite-to-ground quantum key distribution based on a compact source of polarization-entangled photon-pairs, and we have recently completed the integration of a fully functional demonstrator as a milestone towards the flight model. We also briefly describe the design of the optical ground station that we are currently building in Singapore for receiving the quantum signal.

Wildfires are a complex phenomenon emerging from interactions between air, heat, and vegetation, and while they are an important component of many ecosystems’ dynamics, they pose great danger to those ecosystems, and human life and property. Wildfire simulation models are an important research tool that help further our understanding of fire behaviour and can allow experimentation without recourse to live fires. Current fire simulation models fit into two general categories: empirical models and physical models. We present a new modelling approach that uses agent-based modelling to combine the complexity found in physical models with the ease of computation of empirical models. Our model represents the fire front as a set of moving agents that respond to, and interact with, vegetation, wind, and terrain. We calibrate the model using two simulated fires and one real fire, and validate the model against another real fire and the interim behaviour of the real calibration fire. Our model successfully replicates these fires, with a Figure of Merit on par with simulations by the Prometheus simulation model. Our model is a stepping-stone in using agent-based modelling for fire behaviour simulation, as we demonstrate the ability of agent-based modelling to replicate fire behaviour through emergence alone.},

Is it possible at all for consultants to predict and control the changes that their clients ask for? This volume reframes the role of consultants from detached observers wielding a stable body of knowledge useful in all contexts, to that of skilled participants in the conscious and unconscious processes of organisational life. In this book, one of three in a series looking at complexity and management, the expert authors bring together their experiences to provide vibrant accounts of how to lead in everyday organizational situations using practical judgement. The book includes a brief historical introduction to complexity and leadership, real-world narratives illustrating concrete dilemmas in the workplace, and a concluding chapter that draws together the practical and theoretical implications.

This book challenges the more orthodox discourse on leadership and presents a way of thinking about leadership that pays closer attention to experience. The contributors in this book, all senior managers or facilitators of leadership development, resist easy solutions, new typologies or unrealistic prescriptions. Writing about their experiences in Denmark, the {UK}, Israel, Ethiopia, South Africa and beyond, they are less concerned with traits that people can possess and learn, or magical promises of recipes for success, and more with the socio-political process of the interaction between people from which leadership emerges as a theme. We focus on understanding leadership as a practice within which communication, research, imagination and ethical judgements are continuously improvised. So rather than idealising leadership, or reducing it to soothing tools and techniques, we suggest how leaders might become more political, emotionally and socially savvy. This book is written for academics and practitioners with an interest in the everyday challenges of both individual and group practices of formal and informal leaders in different types of organisations, and is an ideal resource for executives and students on leadership development programmes.

Using a two-sector closed economy model that comprises of a conventional goods-producing sector and a research and development sector, their model incorporates two key aspects of knowledge: technology and human capital. Steady-state equilibrium conditions show that the growth rate of per capita income hinges on the growth rate of human capital. While the growth rate of human capital has been previously shown to affect the growth of the economy in transition between steady states or balanced growth paths, the authors are the first to link the growth rate of human capital to the steady-state growth rate of productivity and output per worker. Furthermore, this result does not exhibit scale effects or policy invariance, both of which have been longstanding concerns with the predictions of endogenous growth models developed in the 1990s.},

	abstract = {"If you're like most people, you probably believe that humans are the most intelligent animals on our planet. But there's another kind of entity that can be far smarter: groups of people. In this groundbreaking book, Thomas Malone, the founding director of the {MIT} Center for Collective Intelligence, shows how groups of people working together in superminds--like hierarchies, markets, democracies, and communities--have been responsible for almost all human achievements in business, government, science, and beyond. And these collectively intelligent human groups are about to get much smarter. Using dozens of striking examples and case studies, Malone shows how computers can help create more intelligent superminds simply by connecting humans to one another in a variety of rich, new ways. And although it will probably happen more gradually than many people expect, artificially intelligent computers will amplify the power of these superminds by doing increasingly complex kinds of thinking. Together, these changes will have far-reaching implications for everything from the way we buy groceries and plan business strategies to how we respond to climate change, and even for democracy itself. By understanding how these collectively intelligent groups work, we can learn how to harness their genius to achieve our human goals. "--},

There is broad consensus that Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) and Machine Learning ({ML}) are among the key enablers to this technology. In this work, we present B5GEMINI, which is an {NDT} for 5G and beyond networks that makes an extensive use of {AI} and {ML}. First, we present the infrastructural and architectural components that support B5GEMINI. Next, we explore four paradigmatic applications where {AI}/{ML} can leverage B5GEMINI for building new {AI}-powered applications. In addition, we identify the main components of the {AI} ecosystem of B5GEMINI, outlining emerging research trends and identifying the open challenges that must be solved along the way. Finally, we present two relevant use cases in the application of {NDTs} with an extensive use of {ML}. The first use case lays in the cybersecurity domain and proposes the use of B5GEMINI to facilitate the design of {ML}-based attack detectors and the second addresses the design of energy efficient {ML} components and introduces the modular development of {NDTs} adopting the Digital Map concept as a novelty.},

	abstract = {"What if workforce diversity is more than simply the right thing to do in order to make society more integrated and just? What if diversity can also improve the bottom line of businesses and other organizations facing complex challenges in the knowledge economy? It can. And The Diversity Bonus shows how and why. Scott Page, a leading thinker, writer, and speaker whose ideas and advice are sought after by corporations, nonprofits, universities, and governments around the world, makes a clear and compellingly pragmatic case for diversity and inclusion. He presents overwhelming evidence that teams that include different kinds of thinkers outperform homogenous groups on complex tasks, producing what he calls "diversity bonuses." These bonuses include improved problem solving, increased innovation, and more accurate predictions--all of which lead to better performance and results. Page shows that various types of cognitive diversity--differences in how people perceive, encode, analyze, and organize the same information and experiences--are linked to better outcomes. He then describes how these cognitive differences are influenced by other kinds of diversity, including racial and gender differences--in other words, identity diversity. Identity diversity, therefore, can also produce bonuses. Drawing on research in economics, psychology, computer science, and many other fields, The Diversity Bonus also tells the stories of people and organizations that have tapped the power of diversity to solve complex problems. And the book includes a challenging response from Katherine Phillips of the Columbia Business School" (Publisher's description)},

	abstract = {[The dynamic capabilities framework analyzes the sources and methods of wealth creation and capture by private enterprise firms operating in environments of rapid technological change. The competitive advantage of firms is seen as resting on distinctive processes (ways of coordinating and combining), shaped by the firm's (specific) asset positions (such as the firm's portfolio of difficult-to-trade knowledge assets and complementary assets), and the evolution path(s) it has adopted or inherited. The importance of path dependencies is amplified where conditions of increasing returns exist. Whether and how a firm's competitive advantage is eroded depends on the stability of market demand, and the ease of replicability (expanding internally) and imitatability (replication by competitors). If correct, the framework suggests that private wealth creation in regimes of rapid technological change depends in large measure on honing internal technological, organizational, and managerial processes inside the firm. In short, identifying new opportunities and organizing effectively and efficiently to embrace them are generally more fundamental to private wealth creation than is strategizing, if by strategizing one means engaging in business conduct that keeps competitors off balance, raises rival's costs, and excludes new entrants.]},

            The fundamental goal of artificial intelligence ({AI}) is to mimic the core cognitive activities of human. Despite tremendous success in the {AI} research, most of existing methods have only single-cognitive ability. To overcome this limitation and take a solid step towards artificial general intelligence ({AGI}), we develop a foundation model pre-trained with huge multimodal data, which can be quickly adapted for various downstream cognitive tasks. To achieve this goal, we propose to pre-train our foundation model by self-supervised learning with weak semantic correlation data crawled from the Internet and show that promising results can be obtained on a wide range of downstream tasks. Particularly, with the developed model-interpretability tools, we demonstrate that strong imagination ability is now possessed by our foundation model. We believe that our work makes a transformative stride towards {AGI}, from our common practice of “weak or narrow {AI}” to that of “strong or generalized {AI}”.},

	abstract = {An increase in the frequency of severe fire events, as well as a growing interest in wildfire mitigation strategies, has created a demand for skilled managers of landscape fire and a better community understanding of fire behaviour. While on-ground experience is essential, there is potential to substantially enhance training and community engagement with explanatory simulations. Through this work, we explore landscape fire behaviour as a complex system where understanding key behaviour characteristics is often more important and achievable than prediction. It is argued that this approach has particular value in Northern Australia, where fires burn across vast and sparsely inhabited landscapes that are largely under Indigenous ownership. Land and fire management in such complex cross-cultural contexts requires combining traditional and local knowledge with science and technology to achieve the best outcomes. We describe the workings of the model, a stochastic cellular automata fire behaviour simulation, developed through a participatory modelling approach for Northern Australia; the outputs generated; and a range of operational applications. We found that simulation assisted training and engagement through the development of an understanding of fire dynamics through visualisation, underpinned by landscape data sets, and engaging a culturally diverse set of land managers in discussions of fire management. We conclude that there is scope for a broader use of explanatory fire simulations to support development of shared understandings of fire management objectives.},

	abstract = {A potential vorticity ({PV}) diagnostic framework is used to explore the sensitivity of the 3 May 1999 Oklahoma City tornado outbreak to the strength of a particular {PV} anomaly proximate to the geographical region experiencing the tornado outbreak. The results derived from the balanced {PV} diagnosis agree broadly with those obtained previously in a numerical simulation of the same event, while offering additional insight into the nature of the sensitivity. Similar to the findings of other cases, the balanced diagnosis demonstrates that intensifying (removing) the {PV} anomaly of interest increases (decreases) the balanced {CAPE} over the southwestern portion of the outbreak region, reduces (increases) the storm-relative helicity, and increases (reduces) ascent. The latter finding, coupled with the results of the modeling study, demonstrates that intensifying a {PV} anomaly proximate to an outbreak environment can increase the likelihood that more widespread and possibly less tornadic convection will ensue. The overall results of the balanced diagnosis complement those of other case studies, leading to the formulation of a conceptual model that broadly anticipates how the convective regime will respond to changes in intensity of upper-tropospheric weather features.

Understanding our unique social psychology requires accounting not only for the breadth and intensity of human cooperation but also for the variation found across societies, over history, and among behavioral domains. Here, we introduce an expanded evolutionary approach that considers how genetic and cultural evolution, and their interaction, may have shaped both the reliably developing features of our minds and the well-documented differences in cultural psychologies around the globe. We review the major evolutionary mechanisms that have been proposed to explain human cooperation, including kinship, reciprocity, reputation, signaling, and punishment; we discuss key culture–gene coevolutionary hypotheses, such as those surrounding self-domestication and norm psychology; and we consider the role of religions and marriage systems. Empirically, we synthesize experimental and observational evidence from studies of children and adults from diverse societies with research among nonhuman primates.},

	abstract = {"Ludwig Wittgenstein's brief Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1922) is one of the most important philosophical works of the Twentieth Century, yet it offers little orientation for the reader. The first-time reader is left wondering what it could be about, and the scholar is left with little guidance for interpretation. In Tractatus in Context, James C. Klagge presents the vital background necessary for appreciating Wittgenstein's gnomic masterpiece. Tractatus in Context contains the early reactions to the Tractatus, including the initial reviews written in 1922-1924. And while we can't talk with Wittgenstein, we can do the next best thing-hear what he had to say about the Tractatus. Klagge thus presents what Wittgenstein thought about germane issues leading up to his writing the book, in discussions and correspondence with others about his ideas, and what he had to say about the Tractatus after it was written-in letters, lectures and conversations. It offers, you might say, Wittgenstein's own commentary on the book. Key Features: Illuminates what is at stake in the Tractatus, by providing the views of others that engaged Wittgenstein as he was writing it. Includes Wittgenstein's earlier thoughts on ideas in the book as recorded in his notebooks, letters, and conversations as well as his later, retrospective comments on those ideas. Draws on new or little-known sources, such as Wittgenstein's coded notebooks, Hermine's notes, Frege's letters, Hänsel's diary, Ramsey's notes, and Skinner's dictations. Draws connections between the background context and specific passages in the Tractatus, using a proposition-by-proposition commentary"--},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Most trees form symbioses with ectomycorrhizal fungi ({EMF}) which influence access to growth-limiting soil resources. Mesocosm experiments repeatedly show that {EMF} species differentially affect plant development, yet whether these effects ripple up to influence the growth of entire forests remains unknown. Here we tested the effects of {EMF} composition and functional genes relative to variation in well-known drivers of tree growth by combining paired molecular {EMF} surveys with high-resolution forest inventory data across 15 European countries. We show that {EMF} composition was linked to a three-fold difference in tree growth rate even when controlling for the primary abiotic drivers of tree growth. Fast tree growth was associated with {EMF} communities harboring high inorganic but low organic nitrogen acquisition gene proportions and {EMF} which form contact versus medium-distance fringe exploration types. These findings suggest that {EMF} composition is a strong bio-indicator of underlying drivers of tree growth and/or that variation of forest {EMF} communities causes differences in tree growth. While it may be too early to assign causality or directionality, our study is one of the first to link fine-scale variation within a key component of the forest microbiome to ecosystem functioning at a continental scale.},

Exposing the network to tens of thousands of random combinations of inputs and analyzing the combined dynamics of multiple outputs revealed a robust system capable of clustering widely varying input combinations into equivalence classes of biologically relevant cellular responses. This capability was nontrivial in that the network performed sharp, nonfuzzy classifications even in the face of added noise, a hallmark of real-world decision-making.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              This paper aims to identify empirically the influence of learning mechanisms provided by organizations on knowledge sharing in the organizational environment.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              A quantitative study was developed in which a sample of 268 individuals from civil and military organizations of the Federal Direct Administration was researched. The questionnaire used was composed of the Organizational Learning Mechanism Scale, which was adapted at the time of the present study, in addition to a scale on knowledge sharing, which was developed within the scope of this research. After performing the factorial analysis for both scales, a canonical correlation analysis was performed between the group of variables associated with the learning mechanisms (independent variables) and the group of variables on knowledge sharing (dependent variables).
            
            
              Findings
              
                The results found in the canonical correlation analysis indicate that the learning mechanisms are responsible for explaining 35 per cent of the variance (
                R
                ² = 0.352) of the group of variables on knowledge sharing.
              
            
            
              Practical implications
              The findings of this research can help the researched organizations to increase the knowledge management actions, mainly in relation to the actions that favor social interaction among the individuals in the work environment, making possible the exchange of knowledge and experiences in the internal organizational context, and exploring in a positive way actions related to internal acquisition.
            
            
              Social implications
              The deeper knowledge about the relationship between organizational actions promoted by top management and knowledge support decision-making in the organizational environment regarding contextual factors that influence social interaction between individuals. In relation to the sharing of knowledge, a high correlation of knowledge absorption and reproduction aspects with the knowledge sharing phenomenon was perceived, so that the possibility of organizations thinking in ways that provide the individual with formal and informal environments can be foreseen.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The main contributions of this research are to measure the intensity of the relationship between learning mechanisms and knowledge sharing; and to test the predictive effect of learning mechanisms on knowledge sharing. Regarding the methodological aspects, it was opportune to approach the phenomenon through a little used lens in the context of administration research: the analysis of canonical correlation, which represents another look at the influence of the actions of the top management and the interaction of individuals. The discussions and the data analysis carried out in this research allow us to envisage significant contributions of this work to the analysis and theoretical refinement of the study of the variables treated.},

However, there are often problems associated with both learning within projects and learning transfer from projects to the wider organization. Previous research suggests that these problems vary according to the organizational context, in particular the extent to which the organization is centred on the delivery of projects. Also, the link between project-based learning and organizational learning may be far from seamless, and may require the deployment of a range of learning mechanisms to be effective. In this article we explore and explain these problems through an empirical study which examined project-based learning across different organizational contexts. This study highlights the limitations of learning mechanisms based on reflection and codification. It suggests that firms generally only learn from projects, if at all, via the accumulation of experience amongst groups and individuals. The study suggests, however, that the accumulation of experience is most pronounced in organizational contexts which are project centred and where project management capabilities are well developed. In contrast, in organizations where projects are more varied and occasional, the struggle to exploit the highly heterogeneous forms of learning created within projects is greater.},

There is little consideration of the business drivers or strategy affecting organization design decisions. If done systematically, organization design can be a powerful competitive advantage, with organizations creating designs that effectively deploy and align their talent to deliver industry-leading results. But this requires a clear understanding of the business strategy, optimal work processes, and ultimately a well-crafted plan and process for ensuring long-term success. The Organization Design Model utilizes a four-phase framework.

The framework is meant to reduce confusion about learning and knowledge management issues and guide the design of international studies and data analysis. Design/methodology/approach Conceptual discussion and approach are undertaken. The discussion focuses on the extrapolation of the current situation into the future. Findings On the basis of the analysis it is suggested that to be successful in the new economy companies are required to innovate and adopt, hence learn, far more quickly and effectively than their counterparts. Effective learning means shifting not only what gets learned but also how learning takes place and evolves in organizational contexts. This requires developing a strategic learning capability by linking learning with knowledge management in and among organizations. This paper attempted to highlight such a link. Practical implications The paper can help knowledge management and organizational learning managers to develop and implement effective learning and knowledge strategies, leading to the development of sustainable competitive advantage and organizational success. Originality/value The paper shows that integration of knowledge management and organizational learning approaches will place current theories and practices in perspective for the future, making it easier for twenty‐first century organizations and practitioners to reach the right decisions.},

	abstract = {[This paper critically examines the emerging knowledge agenda at the World Bank. From the publication of the World Development Report 1998-99 on "Knowledge for Development" to present discussions around the Global Development Gateway, the World Bank is attempting to carve a niche for itself as the "Knowledge Bank." In doing so it appears to have shifted from merely focusing on the transfer of capital. Instead, it seeks to be a leader in development expertise and knowledge transfers in international development. The paper examines the Bank's conception of knowledge, the rise of knowledge enterprises at the Bank, and the various tensions in its knowledge discourses. It argues that the Bank's knowledge agenda often tends to be centralized and absolutist and draws on economistic and technocratic models. These trends contribute to the emergence of a narrow knowledge agenda that both neglects sociocultural issues and those concerning a wider political economy. Thus, the plural nature of knowledge is denied and the Bank's own problematic role in knowledge generation is not reflected upon.]},

Second, evaluation of the progress of the respective approaches by using common test criteria for knowledge management implementation established in the literature. Findings It was found that all the institutions covered in this contribution have passed the stage of information management and have put active knowledge management systems in place. However, a structured and systematic management of implicit and external knowledge can be found to a lesser extent. Only a few international organizations like {UNDP} or the World Bank have pushed their knowledge management systems to integrate both internal and external, explicit and implicit knowledge. The results show clearly that most international organizations still show much room for improvement regarding their information and knowledge management system.

Scant attention has been paid in the literature, however, to describing specifically what the process of strategic thinking entails, the means through which it produces the benefits it is seen as creating, or how it can be incorporated into current planning practices. This article seeks to address these important issues by arguing that strategic thinking includes five elements: it incorporates a systems perspective, it is intent-focused, involves thinking in time, is hypothesis-driven, and is intelligently opportunistic. Taken together, these elements are capable of creating superior value, in hard to initiate ways, that make organizations more adaptable to change. In order to incorporate strategic thinking into planning processes, however, we must recognize three discrete aspects of the process: repertoire-building, managing the strategic issues agenda, and programming.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: To interpret, within a sociological context, evidence of physician bias in the management and outcomes of coronary heart disease ({CHD}) treatment for African Americans vs Whites.
{DATA} {IDENTIFICATION}: Articles addressing race and ethnic disparities in {CHD}, and gender as an additional risk factor, published since 1980, were searched and reviewed. Source material was identified using the electronic search engines for {MEDLINE} and Sociological
{STUDY} {SELECTION}: Articles were included in the review of race or ethnic disparities in heart disease when they provided direct or indirect evidence of potential sources of physician bias and/or differential treatment for {CHD}. Three types of studies suggest the presence of physician bias, and include those demonstrating: 1) patterned disparities in treatments and interventions; 2) practitioner perceptual bias/stereotyping of patients; and 3) patient perceptions of bias in treatment.
{RESULTS}: A growing body of research supports the presence of physician bias in differential treatment practices for {CHD} based on patient race/ethnicity, and sometimes patient gender and socioeconomic status, which manifests as additional risk factors in the quality of care, pharmacological therapy, and use of invasive procedures. Access to care and patient preferences/behaviors do not fully account for racial disparities in {CHD} treatment.
{CONCLUSION}: Socioeconomics, individual racism, and institutional racism represent 3 predominant pathways to differential treatment for {CHD} that are mediated by the patient-provider relationship. Racial biases are shown to be a part of the social structure of medical practices at both the macro and micro levels. Individual healthcare providers can potentially reduce disparities in Black-White {CHD} treatment and outcomes by examining the patient-provider relationship for bias. Future studies will require addressing more direct ways of measuring, monitoring, and reducing subtle bias in the healthcare system.},

	shorttitle = {Innovating in a secret world},
	abstract = {"Our national security increasingly depends on access to the most sophisticated and advanced technology. Yet the next time we set out to capture a terrorist leader, we may fail. Why? The answer lies in a conflict between two worlds. One is the dynamic, global, commercial world with its thriving innovations. The other is the world of national security, in which innovation is a matter of life or death. The conflict is about secrecy. Innovating in a Secret World is a detailed examination of the U.S. government and innovation landscapes and of the current trends in often secret national security-related research and development (R\&D). Based on case studies, detailed research, and interviews with executives at Fortune 500s, startup entrepreneurs, and military directors and program managers, this accessible and timely book is a must-read. Tina P. Srivastava evaluates whether the strategy of technology innovation in the world of national security unintentionally leaves certain innovations behind or unintentionally precludes certain classes of innovators from participating. She identifies the unintended consequences and emergent behaviors of this conflict. This examination unfolds in a complex, dynamic system that includes the legal framework in which technology innovation must exist. For more than a decade Srivastava has been on the front lines of cutting-edge technology innovation. She suggests focusing on an emerging class of R\&D strategy called "open innovation"--a strategy that broadens participation in innovation beyond an individual organization or division traditionally assigned to perform R\&D activities. Through compelling stories of commercial and early government applications, she shows how open technology innovation strategies can enable, accelerate, and enhance technology innovation. Successful incorporation of open innovation into the previously closed U.S. government R\&D landscape can yield profound benefits to both national security and global leadership."--},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01769},
	abstract = {The development of autonomous agents which can interact with other agents to accomplish a given task is a core area of research in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Towards this goal, the Autonomous Agents Research Group develops novel machine learning algorithms for autonomous systems control, with a specific focus on deep reinforcement learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning. Research problems include scalable learning of coordinated agent policies and inter-agent communication; reasoning about the behaviours, goals, and composition of other agents from limited observations; and sample-efficient learning based on intrinsic motivation, curriculum learning, causal inference, and representation learning. This article provides a broad overview of the ongoing research portfolio of the group and discusses open problems for future directions.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07169},
	abstract = {Exploration in multi-agent reinforcement learning is a challenging problem, especially in environments with sparse rewards. We propose a general method for efficient exploration by sharing experience amongst agents. Our proposed algorithm, called Shared Experience Actor-Critic ({SEAC}), applies experience sharing in an actor-critic framework. We evaluate {SEAC} in a collection of sparse-reward multi-agent environments and find that it consistently outperforms two baselines and two state-of-the-art algorithms by learning in fewer steps and converging to higher returns. In some harder environments, experience sharing makes the difference between learning to solve the task and not learning at all.},
