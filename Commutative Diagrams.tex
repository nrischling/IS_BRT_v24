\section*{Key for Generative Fractal Game (GFG) Diagram}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Players}: Entities or units that participate in the game. They can be individual agents, teams, companies, species, or any defined set of participants.
    
    \item \textbf{GFG (Generative Fractal Game)}: Represents the overarching game structure in which all players operate. It's a dynamic, ever-evolving game where strategies and equilibria can shift over time. 
    
    \item \textbf{Dominant/Dominated Strategies}: These are strategies that, when adopted, yield the best outcome for a player given the strategies chosen by other players. Dominant strategies always yield the best outcome while dominated strategies are sub-optimal.
    
    \item \textbf{Equilibrium}: A state where players have settled on strategies such that no player can benefit from changing their strategy while the other players keep theirs unchanged.
    
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Evolution of Strategies}: Indicates that over time, the strategies that players adopt can change, leading to new equilibria.
    
    \item \textbf{Additive Composition}: Reflects the notion that individual players can come together to form a larger, composite player.
    
    \item \textbf{Arrows}: Indicate relationships, transitions, or influences between the defined components. For instance, the arrow from Players to GFG indicates that players form and participate in the GFG.
\end{itemize}

By integrating Nash's equilibrium concept with the fractal, generative, and incompleteness aspects of GFGs, we can conceptualize a multi-scalar, dynamic system where equilibria at smaller scales contribute to, and are influenced by, equilibria at larger scales. This interplay between scales, the shifting nature of equilibria, and the ever-evolving game dynamics offers a rich tapestry to understand complex systems, whether they be ecological, economic, or organizational.
